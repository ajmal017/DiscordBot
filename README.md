# DiscordBot

A discord bot using the imaplib, email, time and discord.py libraries to access a gmail account and post any alerts based on trading signals to multiple discord channels using an async def- posting data from the email. This could be the raw text, subject, date recieved, sender etc.

This bot was built for commerical functionality for my own startup and runs on a cloud amazon AWS server using crontab for daily reboots.
